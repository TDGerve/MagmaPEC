FeO and Fe2O3 in MagmaPEC
-------------------------

.. important::

    In MagmaPEC, if only FeO or Fe2O3 is included in a composition, it represents total Fe. They only represent :math:`\mathrm{Fe}^{2+}O` and :math:`\mathrm{Fe}^{3+}_{2}\mathrm{O}_{3}`, if both FeO and Fe2O3 are included in the composition.
